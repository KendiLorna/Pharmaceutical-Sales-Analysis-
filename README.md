# Pharmaceutical-Sales-Analysis-
A descriptive analysis of sales data from a pharmaceutical company(2017-2020)

### OVERVIEW
The dataset on pharmaceutical sales was obtained from Kaggle.
[Pharmaceutical sale dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/krishangupta33/pharmaceutical-company-wholesale-retail-data)

The descriptive analysis aimed to uncover trends in sales by time, country, sales representative, channel, product class, etc.

It aimed to show product performance as well as sales reps, and managers' performance.

The insights gained can help in planning for manufacturing/supply chain and allocating marketing resources, training, and incentives for sales teams.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

I imported the CSV file into Power BI and inspected the dataset in Power Query Editor:
Checking for missing or inconsistent data in key columns using column quality and column distribution features.
Checked for duplicate entries(none were found)
Ensured columns have the correct data types for analysis. 

### Data Modelling

I calculated the following measures:

o	Total Sales

````Total sales = SUM('pharma-data'[Sales])  ````

o	Quantity sold

````Quantity sold = SUM('pharma-data'[Quantity]) ````

o	Customer count

```` Customer Count = DISTINCTCOUNT('pharma-data'[Customer Name]) ````

o	Distributor count

```` Distributor Count = DISTINCTCOUNT('pharma-data'[Distributor]) ````

o	Sales representative count

````Sales rep count = DISTINCTCOUNT('pharma-data'[Name of Sales Rep]) ````

o	Average sales

``` Average sales = AVERAGE('pharma-data'[Sales]) ```

o	Product count

````Product count = DISTINCTCOUNT('pharma-data'[Product Name]) ````

### Visualization Creation
1.	Cards: 
To visualize major metrics such as customers, distributors, total sales, etc.
2.	Map Visualization: 
To visualize sales by country and city bubble size was used to indicate sales volume.
3.	Line Chart: 
To display monthly sales trends.
4.	Bar Chart: 
Compare sales performance by sales rep.
5.	Pie Chart: 
To show the percentage contribution of each product class to total sales.
6.	Table: 
Display aggregated sales data by team and sales manager.
7.	Slicers: 
By country, channel, team, and year to filter the visualizations for a granular view.

### Recommendation

Planning marketing activities and budget allocation should be based on region, channel, and products performance.

Measure the impact of marketing campaigns on prescription and sales increases by comparing sales before and after promotional activities (discounts, free samples).

Regulatory and compliance monitoring- sales trends can inform the impact of recalls on sales.

Inventory and supply chain optimization - forecast demand trends to prevent overstocking or stockouts.

Assess how competitor activity affects drug sales.

Further investigation into customer and prescription behavior to identify the most prescribed drugs and trends in physician prescribing habits.

Segment customers (hospitals, pharmacies) based on purchase frequency and volume for focused marketing.

Analyze repeat vs. new customers to determine brand loyalty.

Sales performance analysis to identify top-performing drugs and sales reps based on revenue and sales volume, regions, and seasons.
